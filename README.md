# Face Aging Model â€“ Learning Summary

This repository showcases my learning journey through the "Face Aging Model" project, which helped me understand Python, deep learning frameworks, and computer vision techniques step by step.

## What I Learned

### **Section 1: Python and NumPy Essentials**
- I revised the core concepts of Python such as:
  - Conditional statements, loops, lists, and dictionaries.
- I explored NumPy for scientific computing:
  - Learned how to create arrays, perform operations, and reshape/index data.
  - Practiced common data manipulation tasks essential for ML workflows.
- This section helped me build confidence in using Python for data-driven tasks.

### **Section 2: PyTorch and TensorFlow Basics**
- I was introduced to PyTorch and TensorFlow, two key deep learning libraries.
- I learned:
  - How to define and work with tensors.
  - How to build simple neural network models.
  - How data flows through layers and how to structure a training loop.
- This gave me a good understanding of both frameworks and how they differ.

### **Section 3: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- I studied how CNNs work and why they are useful for image-based tasks.
- I implemented CNNs in three ways:
  - From scratch using NumPy to understand internal mechanics.
  - Using PyTorch for practical deep learning model building.
  - Using TensorFlow/Keras for higher-level model design.
- I learned to reshape image data, use activation functions, and calculate losses.

### **Section 4: Transformers**
- I explored OpenCV for image processing:
  - Learned to read, transform, and analyze images.
  - Applied techniques like thresholding, blurring, contours, and color space conversion.
- I practiced face detection and recognition using camera and dataset-based input.
- I also learned Pillow (PIL) for basic image editing like cropping and resizing.

#### Now, all that's left in this project is to learn about GAN's and bring everything together and start building the complete Face Aging Model.
